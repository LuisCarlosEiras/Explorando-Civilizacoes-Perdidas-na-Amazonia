Dataset Description
Satellite imagery and map sources:

Google Earth Engine (GEE): one‑click access to Sentinel‑1/‑2, NICFI, GEDI, SRTM, and Landsat.

European Space Agency: a surplus of incredible open-source data collected over the last decades.

NASA: The NASA catalogue is open to use and home to 25,000+ data sets.

OpenTopography LiDAR for High-res canopy-penetrating elevation (1-10m).

Sentinel-2 optical imagery for 10m, 13-band scenes (good for vegetation scars).

AWS CLI: covers swaths of western Amazon.

Archaeological point data:

The Archeo Blog shares sampled data already drawn from the Amazonian region.
